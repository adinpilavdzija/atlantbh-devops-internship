# 5 Bash scripting tasks
01 Write a script that gets CPU and Memory usage

02 Write a script that tests connectivity to a list of websites and reports the status

03 Write a script that pings a host and reports latency
 
04 Write a script that traces the path of a network packet from the source to a destination

05 Write a script that tests the DNS resolution time for a list of domains


# Notes
- [Shell style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html)
- Always quote strings containing variables, command substitutions, spaces or shell meta characters, unless careful unquoted expansion is required or itâ€™s a shell-internal integer (see next point).
- $# - special variable that represents the number of command-line arguments
- "$@" - special variable that represents all the command-line arguments passed to a script or function. It is often used to reference multiple arguments as a list.
- "${websites[@]}" - used to expand an array called websites into a list of elements, where each element is enclosed in double quotes; often used when you want to work with array elements that may contain spaces or other special characters
- dig - DNS lookup utility; performs the DNS resolution and capture the output
- awk - pattern scanning and processing language
- awk '{print $4}' - used to extract and print the fourth field (column) from each line of input data
- cut -d '%' -f 1 - splits each line of input text using the '%' character as the delimiter and then print the first field (part) of each split line.
- vm_stat - macOS command-line utility that provides detailed information about virtual memory statistics on your system
- There is no need in using --output /dev/null together with --silent.
--silent flag will not show any output, as you mentioned here: "curl will be mute".
--output is more used when you need to save something, for example like downloading a file.

## Curl
--output /dev/null OR -o /dev/null # stdout redirected to /dev/null which discards any data that is written to it and reports back that the write operation is successful

--silent OR -s # silent or quiet mode, without showing progress meter or error messages, makes curl mute

--fail OR -f # fail silently (no output at all) on server errors

--write-out "%{time_total}\n" OR -w "%{time_total}\n" # defines format of display on stdout after a completed and successful operation

## Exit code
Exit code 0 - Success  
Exit code 1 - General errors, Miscellaneous errors, such as "divide by zero" and other impermissible operations  
Exit code 2 - Misuse of shell builtins (according to Bash documentation). Example: empty_function() {}
